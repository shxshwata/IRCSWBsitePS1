# I am going to list the steps necessary for this to be hosted and accessed on a search engine. ðŸ–¥
# 1. Purchase a web hosting service. 
- The web hosting service will give the SSL certificate, etc. Web hosting servers are the space where the website can live and be stored while being accessible on the larger web. So a web hosting package is fundamental for the website to go live online. 
# 2. Get a domain name.
- A domain name is what serves as the title for the website. That can be bought on a site like godaddy, etc.
# 3. Connect the domain to the web host.
- This is the final step and the website will be live and searchable on a search engine.
